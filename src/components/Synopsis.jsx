        Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? It all happens automatically. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. This is the way you take out your flustrations. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You can get away with a lot. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's have a nice tree right here. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.
